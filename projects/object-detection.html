    <p>
        This project implements a real-time object detection system using YOLOv5 with custom dataset training for specific use cases. 
        The system is capable of detecting multiple objects in images and video streams with high accuracy, achieving 92% mAP on test data.

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Object detection is a computer vision technique that allows us to identify and locate objects in an image or video. 
        With this kind of identification and localization, object detection can be used to count objects in a scene and determine and track their precise locations, 
        all while accurately labeling them.
    </p>
    <p>
        For this project, I implemented YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection algorithm. 
        YOLO (You Only Look Once) is one of the most famous object detection algorithms due to its speed and accuracy.

    <h2>Technical Details</h2>
    <p>
        The project is built using PyTorch and the YOLOv5 architecture. The model was trained on a custom dataset of over 10,000 annotated images,
        with data augmentation techniques applied to improve generalization. The training process involved:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data collection and annotation using LabelImg</li>
        <li>Data preprocessing and augmentation</li>
        <li>Model training with hyperparameter optimization</li>
        <li>Model evaluation and performance analysis</li>
        <li>Deployment and optimization for real-time inference</li>
    </ul>

<div class="project-section">
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
        The final model achieved 92% mAP (mean Average Precision) on the test dataset, with a processing speed of 30 FPS on a standard GPU.
        The model was successfully deployed in a real-world application for automated inventory management, reducing manual counting errors by 95%.
