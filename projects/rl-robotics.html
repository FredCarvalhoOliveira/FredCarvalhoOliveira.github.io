        This project focuses on creating a reinforcement learning environment for robotic arm control using 
        PyTorch and OpenAI Gym, enabling precise object manipulation. The system learns optimal control 
        policies through trial and error, achieving high success rates in complex manipulation tasks.

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful approach for training robots to perform complex tasks 
        without explicit programming. By learning from interactions with the environment, RL agents can 
        discover optimal policies for controlling robotic systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this project, I developed a custom RL environment for a robotic arm, implementing various 
        state-of-the-art algorithms to train the agent for precise object manipulation tasks. The system 
        was designed to be sample-efficient and robust to variations in the environment.

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
        The trained policies achieved a success rate of 92% on a variety of manipulation tasks, including 
        pick-and-place, stacking, and insertion. The system demonstrated robustness to variations in object 
        properties and environmental conditions, making it suitable for real-world applications.
