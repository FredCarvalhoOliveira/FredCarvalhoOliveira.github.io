    <p>
        This project involves building a StyleGAN2 implementation to generate artistic images based on a custom 
        dataset of paintings, with interactive style mixing capabilities. The system can create novel, high-quality 
        artistic images in various styles and allows for fine-grained control over the generation process.

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have revolutionized the field of AI-generated art by enabling 
        the creation of high-quality, novel images. StyleGAN2, in particular, offers unprecedented control over 
        the generation process through its style-based architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this project, I implemented and trained a StyleGAN2 model on a curated dataset of fine art paintings 
        from various periods and styles. The resulting system can generate new artistic images and allows for 
        interactive style mixing and manipulation.

    <h2>Technical Details</h2>
    <p>
        The project is built using PyTorch and the StyleGAN2 architecture. The implementation includes several 
        technical innovations:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Custom data preprocessing pipeline for art images</li>
        <li>Modified StyleGAN2 architecture with improved quality</li>
        <li>Distributed training across multiple GPUs</li>
        <li>Perceptual path length regularization for smoother interpolation</li>
        <li>Style mixing regularization for better disentanglement</li>
        <li>Interactive web interface for art generation</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="project-section">
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
        The trained model generates high-quality artistic images at 1024x1024 resolution with a Fr√©chet Inception 
        Distance (FID) score of 4.7, indicating excellent visual quality. The style mixing capabilities allow for 
        creative exploration of artistic styles, enabling users to create unique artworks by combining elements 
        from different artistic traditions.
