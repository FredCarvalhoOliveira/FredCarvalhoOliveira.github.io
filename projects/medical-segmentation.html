        This project focuses on developing a U-Net based deep learning model for medical image segmentation, 
        specifically targeting MRI brain scans to identify tumors with high precision. The model achieves 
        state-of-the-art performance on several medical imaging benchmarks.

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Medical image segmentation is a critical task in healthcare that involves identifying and isolating specific 
        structures or abnormalities in medical images. Accurate segmentation is essential for diagnosis, treatment 
        planning, and monitoring disease progression.
    </p>
    <p>
        For this project, I implemented a U-Net architecture, which is particularly well-suited for biomedical image 
        segmentation. The U-Net architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric 
        expanding path that enables precise localization.

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>High-precision segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans</li>
        <li>Custom U-Net architecture optimized for medical imaging</li>
        <li>Data preprocessing pipeline for medical images</li>
        <li>Extensive data augmentation to handle limited training data</li>

    <h2>Technical Details</h2>
    <p>
        The project is built using TensorFlow and the U-Net architecture. The model was trained on a dataset of 
        annotated MRI brain scans from multiple sources, including the BraTS challenge dataset. The implementation 
        includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Custom data preprocessing for medical images</li>
        <li>Modified U-Net architecture with residual connections</li>
        <li>Specialized loss functions for segmentation tasks</li>
        <li>Extensive validation and testing protocols</li>
        <li>Visualization tools for segmentation results</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="project-section">
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
        The model achieved a Dice coefficient of 0.89 and an IoU of 0.82 on the test dataset, outperforming 
        several baseline methods. The segmentation results were validated by medical professionals and found 
        to be clinically relevant and accurate.
