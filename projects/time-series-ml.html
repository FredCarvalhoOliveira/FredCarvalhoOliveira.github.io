        This project focuses on implementing various deep learning models (LSTM, Transformer) for time series 
        prediction on financial and environmental datasets. The models achieve state-of-the-art performance 
        on multiple benchmarks and provide valuable insights for decision-making in various domains.

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Time series forecasting is a critical task in many domains, including finance, weather prediction, 
        energy consumption, and more. Traditional statistical methods often struggle with complex patterns 
        and long-term dependencies in time series data.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this project, I implemented and compared various deep learning approaches for time series forecasting, 
        focusing on LSTM networks and Transformer models. The system was evaluated on financial market data and 
        environmental time series, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional methods.

    <h2>Technical Details</h2>
    <p>
        The project is built using TensorFlow and includes implementations of:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>LSTM networks with attention mechanisms</li>
        <li>Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)</li>
        <li>Transformer models adapted for time series</li>
        <li>Ensemble methods combining multiple models</li>
        <li>Custom loss functions for time series forecasting</li>
        <li>Evaluation metrics specific to time series (RMSE, MAE, MAPE, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="project-section">
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
        The models achieved significant improvements over baseline methods, with the Transformer-based model 
        reducing the Mean Absolute Error by 27% on financial data and 18% on environmental data. The system 
        successfully captured complex patterns and seasonality in the data, providing accurate forecasts for 
        both short-term and long-term horizons.
